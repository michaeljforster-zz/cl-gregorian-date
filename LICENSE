Date algorithms
Copyright 1998, Peter Baum

Although all rights are reserved under the copyright laws, programmers
may implement the algorithms without permission. However, I would ask
that if this is done for any of the algorithms that are not known to
be fully documented elsewhere, a reference be made to this
document. Doing so will assure full and consistent documentation,
minimize the propagation of any errors that might be discovered, and
provide a central location for any improvements that are made in the
future.
